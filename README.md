FormValidate
============

PHP Form Validation Class


Loosely patterned on the interface from the Codeigniter form validation library, but written from scratch in PHP 5.3+. No dependencies. Includes a full set of unit tests in PhpUnit format.

Originally written to use with various Micro-frameworks as they (generally) don't have this function and I couldn't find a usable library that someone else had written.
